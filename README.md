# project10-restaurantPage
My tenth Odin project - Restaurant Page

I'm going to build a Restaurant Page with three tabs.
The main goal here is to split my javascript into modules and use Webpack.
I'll also take a chance to continue practicing DOM manipulation by dynamically rendering
the page contents!
